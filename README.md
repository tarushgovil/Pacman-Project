# Pacman Project
My project's name is 112 Pacman.

There are 3 modes in this game. 
1. Single Player 
2. Multiplayer
3. Ghost Mode

In single player, you are pacman and your goal is to collect all the coins and escape the ghosts. You have 3 lives. You can also view your high scores by clicking the high scores button on the start page.

In multiplayer, two people can play this game. There are two different pac mans. One is controlled with up, down, left, and right. The other is controlled with “A, W, S, D”. Both pac mans have to stay away from the ghosts while trying to collect as many coins as possible. If at the end both pac mans are alive and all the coins have been collected by both, whichever pacman has more coins wins the game.

In ghost mode, you are the ghost and your job is to attack the 3 pac mans in a given amount of time. If you fail to do so, you lose the game. 

The project can be run using the graphics package tkinter. There are 4 files (mainTP3.py, singleplayer.py,multiplayer.py, and ghostmode.py) and to run the game you run the file mainTP3.py. Please place all 4 files mainTP3.py, singleplayer.py, multiplayer.py, and ghost mode.py along with all the images and image_util in the same folder to run the game.
